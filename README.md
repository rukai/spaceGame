# Some space game

Wheeeee!
A space game for the second COMP115 assignment at Macquarie Uni.

Why on earth are you compiling png's into a java array you ask?
The assignment only allows a single .pde file for submission.

## Requirements

*   Unix for the build scripts
*   Java/Processing

## Building

If you are using a unix system simply use the `run.sh` or `compile.sh` scripts.
Otherwise you will need to run the CompileGraphics processing sketch and then run the main processing sketch
